# Execution ledger

Objective: full v1 through C0–C4, seven classes, all advertised skills, five
acts, 30–50 active-hour fresh first clear, all G0–G7. Checkpoint progress does
not reduce the objective. No public deployment.

2026-10-20; phoenixzqy/D2H5TextGame; branch `feat/playable-foundations`;
implementation base `9e0ef64`. Historical baseline remains unchanged.
Current implementation evidence lives in `evidence/`.

## Current cards

| Card | State | Evidence / remaining |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P00 | in-progress | Producer F01–F21 mapping and assertion audit below. Expand current-head measurements and strict tests with each fix. |
| P00b | accepted tooling fix | `test:related` now invokes Vitest's `related --run`; scoped 25 tests pass in 1.45 s, broad 226 pass/1 existing skip in 10.70 s (over budget). Producer approval; BUG-003. |
| P01 | in-progress | D12 save/import contract recorded. Offline portion, D01–D11/D13–D14 pending; D04/D06 source reconciliation under review. |
| P02 | pending dependencies | No accepted production harness. Existing sim is outside workspace discovery. Split fixture/schema, adapter, reporting. |
| P03a | accepted slice | `6f1dafd` + `76db166`; independent source approval, U/T/L/B and 10 browser cases pass. [Evidence](evidence/P03a-save-integrity.md). Full D12/G1/G6 remain unaccepted. |
| P03b/P04 | ready for reproduction | Capacity/overflow and quest event/reward integrity; expand small child cards. |
| P05a | accepted slice | `2458ee7`; source-local error state, 13 focused tests and actual-component desktop/mobile proof. [Integrated evidence](evidence/P05a-P06a-foundations.md). D13/F19 remain open. |
| P05b | needs D13 | Resolver precedence, metadata category, cross-surface identity. |
| P06a | accepted slice | `10ce45d`; battle-local summon identity, full A/A and A/B/A replay, live/dead collisions. Independent TD approval. [Evidence](evidence/P05a-P06a-foundations.md). |
| Remaining P06–P10 | pending dependencies | D04–D06/shared effects first. All skills remain behavior-unaccepted. |
| P11–P15 | pending dependencies | Rewards/idle, eligibility, economy, campaign and pacing. |
| P16–P18 | pending | Critical UI/a11y/performance, offline/PWA, endgame and achievements. |
| P19 | pending dependencies | Full matrix, actual required CI, independent review/QA, holdout, soak, human playtest. |

C0 in progress; C1–C4 pending. No G0–G7 gate is fully accepted.

## Feature traceability

Paths relative to `src/`. Existing test anchors are starting points, not proof.
Every feature requires positive/negative assertions, final SHA, exact commands,
evidence, independent review/QA and explicit remaining gaps before acceptance.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F01 | design/engine/frontend/QA; P06–P10 | classes → progression → playerStore → character | Seven legal growth/allocation/respec/save paths; playerStore/CharacterCreate tests; earned seven-class browser matrix. |

All feature rows remain partial/unverified. Mapping accepts no feature.

## Assertion and tooling debt

Strengthen required regressions atomically with their associated fixes.

- `full-loop.spec.ts`: require victory, intended nonzero loot, successful equip
  and legal allocation; remove optional paths/swallowed failures.
- `save-load.spec.ts`: remove mobile exclusion; replace allocation ≥0 with a
  known successful allocation and exact persistence.
- `no-gold-currency.spec.ts`: require victory/reward summary before currency
  assertions; verify no-gold runtime/data identities separately.
- `merc-fights.spec.ts`: require an actual merc action/contribution.
- `post-victory-cta.spec.ts`: require victory before victory controls.
- `loot-drop-rate.spec.ts`: boosted fixtures prove transport/eligibility only.
- Resolved tooling defect: `test:related` now uses `vitest related --run` for
  locked Vitest 1.6.1. Use `--project=engine` for a surgical engine loop; broad
  dependency fanout can exceed the related-test budget (BUG-003).

## P05a-image-source-recovery

State: accepted slice at `2458ee7`; independent frontend/QA implementation,
parent source review and integrated U/T/L/B plus D/M validation.
Own: `ui/GameImage.tsx`, `ui/GameCard.tsx`, their tests, focused browser spec,
and BUG-002. Depends on existing contracts; D13 resolver policy is separate.

1. error(A)→rerender(B) displays B without parent remount.
2. failure(B) restores stable fallback; missing source safe.
3. Preserve sizing/crop/stealth behavior.

Reproduce/report before patch, related RTL, integrated U/T/L/B and focused
actual-component desktop/mobile browser proof. This card does not accept F19.

## P03b01-legacy-container-visibility

State: in-progress; independent frontend/QA worktree. Producer approved this
child before capacity/award changes. Own `BackpackGrid.tsx`, focused RTL and
browser specs, BUG-005 and scoped visibility contract (five files).

1. Every saved item remains visible/selectable above the display capacity.
2. Capacity controls empty placeholders only; 99/100/101 and 499/500/501 covered.
3. Ordinary import can recover the final over-cap item using existing actions
   on desktop/mobile; preserve unrelated items and persist recovery.

Do not lower insertion limits while reward callers ignore rejected `addItem`.
Shared limits, transaction atomicity and recoverable awards remain later P03b.
